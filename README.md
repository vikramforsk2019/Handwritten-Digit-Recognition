# MINIST_HAND_WRITTEN_DIGIT_PROJECT
# RECOGNIZATION/HANDWRITTEN
How to Develop a Convolutional Neural Network From Scratch for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification.

# Preview
IT is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

# Overview
FRONT-END
Technologies used: As it is a web application,the front-end of this project has been created using HTML (for layout of the webpages), CSS(for styling of the pages), BOOTSTRAP ( for styling and responsiveness), AJAX ( for dynamically communicating with the server) & JAVA-SCRIPT (for adding activity to the page).

BACK-END
Technologies used: As the backend is totally written in PYTHON programming language, things were pretty much easier to be done because Python has a lot of libraries available with it. We used FLASK for writing the server side work. (Django could also have been a great option if we had a wider spectrum of requirements.
